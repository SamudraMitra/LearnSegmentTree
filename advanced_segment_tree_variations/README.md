# 🌲 Learning Segment Tree

This repository contains my implementations and experiments with **Segment Trees**, progressing from basic structures to more generalized and reusable designs.

📖 [Reference material](https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/segment_tree.html)

## 🚀 Part 2 — Advanced Segment Tree Variation

### Goals

- Implement a non-trivial segment tree

### Tasks

- [ ] Solve [spoj gss3 question](https://www.spoj.com/problems/GSS3/)

---

## ▶️ How to Run Tests

### Step 1 — Navigate

```bash
cd advanced_segment_tree_variations
```

### Step 2 — Run judge script (PowerShell)

```powershell
.\judge.ps1
```

---

## ⚙️ What the judge does

- Compiles your C++ files
- Runs all test cases automatically
- Compares outputs with expected results
- Displays PASS / FAIL for each test

---

## Solutions

- Present in the solutions folder

## 🛠 Requirements

- C++17 or later
- g++
- PowerShell (Windows)

Optional manual compile:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp
```
